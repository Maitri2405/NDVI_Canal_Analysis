## Impact of Canal Irrigation via Remote Sensing

## Aim

To evaluate the **impact of canal irrigation** on vegetation and land productivity using **remote sensing tools** like Google Earth Engine. The goal was to assess whether areas under canal command showed improvement in vegetation cover and water availability over time.

## Dataset & Tools

- **Shapefiles** of 9 major Indian canal command areas (digitized in QGIS)
- **NDVI, LAI, Precipitation & LULC** datasets extracted using Google Earth Engine
- **MODIS, Landsat, CHIRPS** satellite data sources
- **Python** used for trend analysis and visualizations

## A Simple Approach

1. Digitized the canal command areas using **QGIS**
2. Extracted multi-year satellite data using **GEE JavaScript API**
3. Conducted timeseries analysis for vegetation and rainfall indicators
4. Analyzed spatial and temporal changes using **Python notebooks**

## Findings

- **NDVI and LAI values increased** post canal construction, indicating improved vegetation health.
- **LULC changes** showed a shift from barren to agricultural land in many command areas.
- This demonstrates the **positive long-term effect** of canal irrigation.
